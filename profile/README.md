## 🎯 Purpose

Popov R&D exists to validate engineering ideas through hands-on experimentation.  
We focus on producing:

- Production-grade backend patterns (JVM, GraalVM, microservices)
- Scalable frontend architecture (React, Next.js, SSR)
- Algorithms and data structures applied to practical domains
- Cloud-native orchestration (AWS, serverless, containers)
- System design strategies for high-load, event-driven platforms
- CI/CD pipelines, observability, and DevOps best practices
- Public experiments, performance benchmarks, and architecture blueprints

🎥 We also plan to share selected insights and walkthroughs on our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@popov-rnd).

All our work is grounded in reproducible, open implementations — not theory.

## 🧭 Values

At Popov R&D, we care deeply about:

- **Clarity over cleverness** – simple, readable solutions win over magic tricks
- **Performance with purpose** – we optimize where it matters, and measure everything
- **Reproducibility** – every experiment should be repeatable, transparent, and documented
- **Pragmatism** – we focus on what works in production, not what sounds good in theory
- **End-to-end thinking** – from frontend UX to backend systems to DevOps pipelines
- **Continuous learning** – we document our discoveries, failures, and improvements openly
